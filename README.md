# reviewnbtest
testing github integration with review nb

With some example code, testing ReviewNB as a way to integrate into the existing workflows and code review process @ the Met Office.
Currently the jupyter notebooks display as huge JSON blobs which makes it difficult for code review on github during a PR

Create another branch and a PR to see how ReviewNB handles the review process.
